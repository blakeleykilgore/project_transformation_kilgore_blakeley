### Resources:
* I did not use any
resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments:
As discussed in the documentation, I had issues with sizing the banner background image. I hope to continue to look up solutions to this problem. I also have worries that I am making too many commits. Is it all right to redo things throughout a project? I felt I could have lowered the number of commits but planning better or undoing commits.
